# Extra features in this theme

## Header

It adds a header that provides site-wide links across all of our documentation.

## CSS

We download the Mozilla Fira CSS and embed it in our side, since this is what our logo uses.

We also define several custom CSS rules to handle a header with cross-organization links.

## Extensions

**`sphinxext.opengraph`** adds OpenGraph tags to each of our sites.
It also pre-configures the social media cards to use `2i2c.org`.

**`sphinx-togglebutton`** allows us to make admonitions toggle-able with `:class: dropdown`.

**`sphinx-copybutton`** adds a copy button to each of our code blocks.
